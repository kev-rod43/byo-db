# BYO-DB

## Description

Build Your Own-DB (BYO-DB) is a DBMS (DataBase Management System) that serves as an interface between the end-user and the Database. 

The motivation behind the BYO-DB was to give users with a non-technical background the ability to create and manage their own databases in a user-friendly and interactive way. This project gives the end user all the tools necessary 
to store, organize, access, query, and manipulate the data within a Database. Furthermore, BYO-DB, also displays a visual represantion of the data within their database to further facilitate the decision making capabilities of the end-user.
